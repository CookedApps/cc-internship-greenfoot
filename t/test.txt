 A Stupid Kinda Ex President Of The USA
By Donald J. Trump
An Original Song
A Stupid Kinda Ex President Of The USA


He gets on with life as a ex president of the USA,
He's a stupid kinda chap.
He likes playing Golf on Sundays,
He likes ignoring Corona in the week.
He likes to contemplate war.
But when he starts to daydream,
His mind turns straight to Putin.

Five six seven eight...

Does he love Putin more than war?
Does he love Putin more than war?

He likes to use words like 'Build a Wall,'
He likes to use words like 'China.'
He likes to use words about war.
But when he stops his talking,
His mind turns straight to Putin.

Five six seven eight...

Does he love Putin more than war?
Does he love Putin more than war?

He likes to hang out with Mike pence,
He likes to kick back with not Joe Biden,
But when left alone,
His mind turns straight to Putin.

Five six seven eight...

Does he love Putin more than war?
Does he love Putin more than war?

He's not too fond of north Corea,
He really hates StepStone,
But he just thinks back to Putin,
And he's happy once again.

Five six seven eight...
